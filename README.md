# **Resolve Inflation**
This application has a solution to the current situation in society.
When inflation is rising and while the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and we get more divided than ever before.

All we do, or at least say, is; we strive for "equality".
But I say; all we do is dream.
It's time to start striving towards "reality".

So! Here's my solution to the problem.

## How to dev
Standing in the project directory you can: 
```
npm install
npm start
```

The project should now be served:
[`http://localhost:3000`](https://this_is_url/)


Real time reload when u make changes. <br>
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
